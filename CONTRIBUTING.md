# compile-latex Contributing guidelines

Hi there! Many thanks for taking an interest in improving compile-latex.

We try to manage the required tasks for compile-latex using GitHub issues, you probably came to this page when creating one.
Please use the prefilled template to save time.

However, don't be put off by this template - other more general issues and suggestions are welcome! Contributions to the code are even more welcome ;)

## Contribution workflow

If you'd like to write some code for compile-latex, the standard workflow
is as follows:

1. Check that there isn't already an issue about your idea in the
   [compile-latex issues](https://github.com/maxulysse/compile-latex/issues) to avoid
   duplicating work.
    * Feel free to add a new issue here for the same reason.
2. Fork the compile-latex repository to your GitHub account
3. Make the necessary changes / additions within your forked repository
4. Submit a Pull Request against the master branch and wait for the code to be reviewed and merged.

If you're not used to this workflow with git, you can start with some [documentation from GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git/).

For further information/help, please consult the [compile-latex documentation](https://github.com/maxulysse/compile-latex#documentation) and don't hesitate to contact us: max.u.garcia@gmail.com
